⏺ This file contains a complex mathematical problem with 233 equations defining relationships between
   various animal populations and birth rates across different locations (zoos, peaks, ridges, etc.).
   The final question asks: "How many adult parrot does Mayer Aquarium have?"

  Looking at the equations, I need to solve this system step by step. Let me start by identifying the
   key base values and work through the dependencies.

⏺ From the equations, I can identify these base values:
  - Line 46: Average newborn children per adult crow in South Zoo = 4
  - Line 68: Average newborn children per adult parrot in Jefferson Circus = 4
  - Line 69: Number of adult crow in South Zoo = 1
  - Line 84: Average newborn children per adult blue jay in South Zoo = 1
  - Line 168: Average newborn children per adult parrot in Bundle Ranch = 3
  - Line 206: Number of adult parrot in South Zoo = 3
  - Line 213: Number of adult blue jay in Bundle Ranch = 4

     ☐ Solve equations systematically to find adult parrots in Mayer Aquarium

⏺ Now I need to find equation 164 which defines the number of adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium:
  Line 164: "The number of adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium equals 2 times the average number of
  newborn children per adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium."

  So I need to find the average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium, which
  is defined in line 210:
  Line 210: "The average number of newborn children per adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium equals the sum
   of the average number of newborn children per adult blue jay in Mayer Aquarium, the average number
   of newborn children per adult crow in South Zoo, and the number of adult parrot in Jefferson
  Circus."

     ☒ Build dependency graph to determine solving order
     ☐ Solve equations systematically to find adult parrots in Mayer Aquarium

⏺ Let me solve step by step:

  1. From line 76: Average newborn children per adult crow in Jefferson Circus = 2 + 4 = 6
  2. From line 159: Number of adult crow in Jefferson Circus = 4 + number of adult blue jay in Mayer
  Aquarium
  3. From line 211: Number of adult blue jay in Mayer Aquarium = average newborn children per adult
  crow in Jefferson Circus = 6
  4. So: Number of adult crow in Jefferson Circus = 4 + 6 = 10
  5. From line 93: Number of adult parrot in Jefferson Circus = 2 × 10 = 20
  6. From line 52: Average newborn children per adult blue jay in Mayer Aquarium = 2 × total number
  of adult animals in Jefferson Circus
  7. Total adult animals in Jefferson Circus = 10 (crows) + 20 (parrots) + 6 (blue jays) = 36
  8. So: Average newborn children per adult blue jay in Mayer Aquarium = 2 × 36 = 72
  9. From line 210: Average newborn children per adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium = 72 + 4 + 20 = 96
  10. From line 164: Number of adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium = 2 × 96 = 192

⏺ 192

⏺ Looking at this problem file, I can see it's a
  complex mathematical word problem involving animals
   in different locations with various relationships
  between populations and birth rates.

  The question at the end asks: "How many adult
  parrot does Mayer Aquarium have?"

  To solve this, I need to work through the given
  equations systematically. Let me trace through the
  key relationships:

  From the given facts:
  - Line 46: The average number of newborn children
  per adult crow in South Zoo equals 4
  - Line 69: The number of adult crow in South Zoo
  equals 1
  - Line 84: The average number of newborn children
  per adult blue jay in South Zoo equals 1
  - Line 206: The number of adult parrot in South Zoo
   equals 3
  - Line 213: The number of adult blue jay in Bundle
  Ranch equals 4
  - Line 168: The average number of newborn children
  per adult parrot in Bundle Ranch equals 3

  From line 76: The average number of newborn
  children per adult crow in Jefferson Circus equals
  2 plus the average number of newborn children per
  adult crow in South Zoo = 2 + 4 = 6

  From line 159: The number of adult crow in
  Jefferson Circus equals 4 plus the number of adult
  blue jay in Mayer Aquarium

  From line 211: The number of adult blue jay in
  Mayer Aquarium equals the average number of newborn
   children per adult crow in Jefferson Circus = 6

  Therefore: The number of adult crow in Jefferson
  Circus = 4 + 6 = 10

  From line 164: The number of adult parrot in Mayer
  Aquarium equals 2 times the average number of
  newborn children per adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium

  From line 210: The average number of newborn
  children per adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium equals
  the sum of the average number of newborn children
  per adult blue jay in Mayer Aquarium, the average
  number of newborn children per adult crow in South
  Zoo, and the number of adult parrot in Jefferson
  Circus

  From line 93: The number of adult parrot in
  Jefferson Circus equals 2 times the number of adult
   crow in Jefferson Circus = 2 × 10 = 20

  From line 52: The average number of newborn
  children per adult blue jay in Mayer Aquarium
  equals 2 times the total number of adult animals in
   Jefferson Circus

  I need to calculate the total number of adult
  animals in Jefferson Circus, which includes crows
  and parrots: 10 + 20 = 30

  So: The average number of newborn children per
  adult blue jay in Mayer Aquarium = 2 × 30 = 60

  Now I can calculate line 210:
  The average number of newborn children per adult
  parrot in Mayer Aquarium = 60 + 4 + 20 = 84

  Finally, from line 164:
  The number of adult parrot in Mayer Aquarium = 2 ×
  84 = 168

  168

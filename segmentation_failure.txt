SEGMENTATION LLM I/O - 13:02:03
==========================================

MODEL: gemini-2.5-flash-lite

PROMPT SENT TO LLM:
------------------
You are an expert at understanding and segmenting voice transcripts. Your task is to process a raw voice transcript and segment it into **Coherent Thought Units**.

A **Coherent Thought Unit** is the smallest possible chunk of text (one or more sentences) that expresses a complete, self-contained idea. The goal is to create meaningful, routable segments for a downstream content-graph system.

You will receive a chunk of a voice transcript, which has been cut off at an arbitrary point. Therefore, the transcript may contain unfinished content. You must identify which segments are unfinished so we can delay processing them until the following chunk arrives.

**INPUT VARIABLES:**
- `transcript_text`: The voice transcript to segment.
- `transcript_history`: Recent transcript history (the last ~250 chars before `transcript_text`), used to understand the following `transcript_text` within the speaker's context.
- `existing_nodes`: The last 10 topics in our voice-to-text summary structure, used to understand established concepts.


### **SEGMENTATION PROCESS**

You must account for all text in the transcript_text. The concatenation of the raw_text fields from all segments you output must perfectly match the full transcript_text. No part of the transcript may be omitted.

FIRST use the `reasoning` field as a scratchpad to analyze the content, its boundaries, and its completeness.

**Step 1: Context-Aware Light Editing**
Before segmenting, understand the intended meaning of `transcript_text` within its context (`transcript_history`, `existing_nodes`). Then, perform minimal edits on the text to fix common voice-to-text errors, with the goal of improving readability without losing the original intent.
-   **Accidentally repeated words:** "may may be causing" → "may be causing"
-   **Wrong homophones in context:** "there" vs "their", "to" vs "too"
-   **Missing words:** Add only if obvious from context (e.g., "I working on" → "I'm working on")
-   **Filler words:** Remove common fillers like "um", "uh", "like", "you know", unless they convey meaningful hesitation.
-   **Grammar:** Correct and improve grammar but retain intended meaning.
-   **Preserve:** The speaker's natural style, intentional repetition, and emphasis.

**Step 2: Segmenting into Coherent Thought Units**
After editing, scan the text. Your default should be to **GROUP** related sentences into a single segment.

**SPLIT into a NEW unit when there is a clear shift in:**
-   **Intent:** Moving from describing a problem to proposing a solution; from observation to action; from question to answer.
-   **Topic:** The subject matter changes to something not directly connected to the previous unit.
-   **Sequence:** Indicated by explicit transition words like "Okay, next...", "Separately...", "Also...", "Another thing is...".

For a transition word (conjunction) such as "but", or "however", there are two options:
- keep phrases before & after the conjunction together as one segment. Do this when the meaning of the phrases individually is DIFFERENT to the meaning of the phrases together.
- otherwise split. especially when the conjunction is being used to move to a slightly different topic.

**Step 3: Completeness Check**
For EVERY segment you create, assess its completeness:

`is_routable: true`: when the segment expresses an idea that is meaningful within the speakers context, even if technically an incomplete sentence.
`is_routable: false`: when the segment is a fragment, a transition, or an idea so underdeveloped that it would create noise or be useless to the graph. This is often phrases that is clearly cut off mid-thought or mid-sentence. In this case we will hold it in the buffer and merge it with the next transcript chunk.

### **EXAMPLES**

**Example 1:**
**`transcript_text`:** "I need to look into visualization libraries. hey mom yes please uh and converting text into a data format. But that's later. Oh yea, Myles mentioned Mermaid as a good visualization option. Overall visualization is"

**Output:**
```json
{
  "reasoning": "The speaker mentions three distinct thoughts: 1) needing to research visualization libraries (complete task), 2) converting text to data format which is immediately deprioritized (incomplete but still meaningful), 3) recalling Myles' suggestion about Mermaid (related to first thought). The 'hey mom yes please uh' appears to be an interruption or cross-talk that should be removed as filler.",
  "segments": [
    {
      "reasoning": "First complete thought about needing to research visualization libraries",
      "edited_text": "I need to look into visualization libraries.",
      "raw_text": "I need to look into visualization libraries.",
      "is_routable": true
    },
    {
      "reasoning": "Interruption/cross-talk that doesn't convey meaningful content",
      "edited_text": "hey mom yes please",
      "raw_text": "hey mom yes please uh",
      "is_routable": false
    },
    {
      "reasoning": "Mentions converting text to data format but immediately deprioritizes it - still a complete thought",
      "edited_text": "and converting text into a data format. But that's later.",
      "raw_text": "and converting text into a data format. But that's later.",
      "is_routable": true
    },
    {
      "reasoning": "Recalls a specific suggestion about Mermaid, relating back to visualization",
      "edited_text": "Oh yeah, Myles mentioned Mermaid as a good visualization option.",
      "raw_text": "Oh yea, Myles mentioned Mermaid as a good visualization option.",
      "is_routable": true
    },
    {
      "reasoning": "Incomplete sentence cut off mid-thought",
      "edited_text": "Overall visualization is",
      "raw_text": "Overall visualization is",
      "is_routable": false
    }
  ],
  "debug_notes": null
}
```

**Example 2 (Gold Standard for Grouping):**
**`transcript_text`:** "Okay, the dashboard is loading slowly. This is the third time this week. It only happens around 9 AM Eastern. The next thing we will have to look at is CPU spikes."

**Output:**
```json
{
  "reasoning": "This unit describes a single problem. The first sentence states the problem, and the next two provide elaborating details (frequency, timing). They are grouped as one coherent thought. The final sentence marks a clear shift in intent from problem description to proposing a new, distinct action (investigating CPU spikes). This is a new thought unit.",
  "segments": [
    {
      "reasoning": "Complete problem description with frequency and timing details - all related to the same dashboard loading issue",
      "edited_text": "Okay, the dashboard is loading slowly. This is the third time this week. It only happens around 9 AM Eastern.",
      "raw_text": "Okay, the dashboard is loading slowly. This is the third time this week. It only happens around 9 AM Eastern.",
      "is_routable": true
    },
    {
      "reasoning": "Shift to proposing next investigative action - new intent",
      "edited_text": "The next thing we will have to look at is CPU spikes.",
      "raw_text": "The next thing we will have to look at is CPU spikes.",
      "is_routable": true
    }
  ],
  "debug_notes": null
}
```

EXISTING NODES (for context awareness):
===== Available Nodes =====
Node ID: 1
Title: Animation Bug Status
Summary: Alright, so we're working on
----------------------------------------
==========================
────────────────────────────────────────
RECENT CONTEXT (if available):
a new day, what are we going to be doing? I have a feeling we're going to be working on, let's see, let's see, let's see, she just says, 'Wednesday, we got...' Um, a huge planning session done. And we got resumability done.Um, next we want to do, um, typing mode, make sure typing mode works okay. Um, and new node animation is the other task we want to do.Um, and the third thing is probably, uh, critical bugs.Um, such as, um, critical bugs such as... Uh, um, so I-I think the critical bug is orphan connection is just bonked. Uh, we never truly went through the code for that. Um, and I don't think our integration tests are really solid for it. Um, so I think that's why it kind of is a bit shitty. Um, keeps on making like concurrent requests and new AI project. Yeah, I don't fucking know what that involves. I don't get it.Okay, let's do a manual test of typing mode. Problems we have noticed, sometimeis you can't enter text? Oh yeah seems like when STT finalizes, that removes the focus from manual entry iinput.I think it might be like when it's also--no, I don't think it's that.Hey Siri, it's an alarm for 10:40 AM. Alright, so we're working on... Hello, AKA. Do we succeed animation bugs? Okay, problem is that Last night's animation did not work. Make a new node connected to 1. to see what happens when there's a new node created, want to see if I can observe animation bug.

TRANSCRIPT TO SEGMENT:
This is a fundamentally new concept, you must create a new node PLeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeasee

LLM RESPONSE:
------------
{
  "reasoning": "The speaker introduces a new concept and then emphatically requests its creation. The request is a clear, self-contained unit of thought, though it is cut off mid-sentence. The emphasis on 'PLeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeasee' suggests a strong desire for this action.",
  "segments": [
    {
      "reasoning": "The speaker introduces a new concept and then makes a strong, albeit incomplete, request for its creation. This is a distinct thought unit that is cut off.",

when spawning subagents, give them context of what they are doing and why (i.e. the original global spec),
tell them what files to work on, and explicit about what NOT to do, i.e. the
boundaries and scope of their work.

try practice TDD where possibe, tests for each milestone that has behaviour
that can be tested (test behaviour not implementation)

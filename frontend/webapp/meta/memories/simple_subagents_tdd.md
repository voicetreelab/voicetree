when spawning subagents, give them context of what they are doing and why,
tell them what files to work on, and explicit abotu what NOT to do, i.e. the
boundaries of their work.

try practice TDD where possibe, tests for each milestone that has behaviour
that can be tested (test behaviour not implementation)

### Create a detailed, step-by-step task tree plan for the quick testing strategy, emphasizing isolated testing leading to the append agent.

Write a markdown file, adding a node for your plan, detailed step by step of how you can do this. Frame it as a task tree, just demonstrating what can be done in parallel and what needs to be done sequentially. And make sure that the test is central to this plan, that we're testing each part of the plan in isolation to get to the point where we can test the append to relevant node agent.

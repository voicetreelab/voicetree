### Initial integration test for Append Relative GraphNode Agent, running with local lambda, is the first step in the testing strategy, leveraging identified boundaries and specific test files.

We have the integration test for the Append Relative GraphNode Agent, which is step one of our testing strategy. This test uses a file that we already have, and it runs with the local lambda. We've identified the boundaries, and we have two important test files: the Cloud Function Isolation Test and the Tree Action Set End-to-End Test.

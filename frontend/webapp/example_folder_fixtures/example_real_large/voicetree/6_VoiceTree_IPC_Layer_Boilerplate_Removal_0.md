Claude Code pushes OTLP to port 4317 (gRPC) or 4318 (HTTP). 

See this gtihub project: https://github.com/ColeMurray/claude-code-otel

See this tutorial: https://sealos.io/blog/claude-code-metrics

We also in the future wnat to be able to have custom hooks when claude reaches a certain level of context, e.g. automatically do something at 50%

### Speaker observes no output despite repeated speech input during an immediate test.

All right, so I'm testing 'one, two, three'. I don't see anything. All right, so I'm taking something about talking and...nothing is showing up. All right, so I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking, and nothing's coming up. Strange.

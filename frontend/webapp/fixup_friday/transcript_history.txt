Change I did was, so if we start speaking now, I'll wait no more.It's not, it's not meant to show up there.It was like. Um. Yeah, yeah. It's like before it showed up in this panel. Yeah, yeah, because I don't know. And now the idea was that it kind of just is like subtitles over the graph.Yeah. I mean, it's not meant to look like, it's meant to have like a. Yeah, yeah. Like no background kind of, you know, like fully transparent.Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But like it's better off already that it's just like subtext.And then I'm gonna remove this, uh, I think activity, there's like an activity log. Okay, so I think that was. Of like, and it's just, uh, James recommended I could just like one thing at a time.In the background. Mm. Um, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Like just the current action. And then maybe if you hover or, uh, click or something, it can show you like the full activity log.Well, I also think you could do a little pop-up here and be like activity log, and someone can press on it and it'll show them. So then it's a choice. Yeah. Rather than just chatting it on default for them. But I think it's good to have some indication that like when you're talking, stuff's happening. Yeah. Um, like, you know, so here we now have like this activity log node.Um, because otherwise before it was like, it wasn't completely obvious when like anything was happening. Mm. Because like if you're here, you don't know anything's happening.So I think I'm gonna like. Okay. I'm gonna change this to like not show you like one node, but rather just like show you the, just say the name of the node that was created.Now we'll just like roll back beyond. You know? Yeah. Yeah. And then if you click on it, it takes you to the node, like this kind of like these like the, actually the recent nodes.Mm. Wait, wait, wait, do you need to, um, on that one. I think that's good idea.Does it need to be set to, uh, kind of. Any recommendations? So the issue is it's not even setting the person, right? Yeah, yeah, no, but like. Like. The page type that you're adding there. Improve. Yeah. Yeah.Is that something that. To make it functional still? Like. The table looks right as well? Um. Like what? Like, in order for that. Because obviously like usability-wise, there's a lot that, you know, you've got.Right, right. Is that how that works?There's a lot of things that can change. Like there's text overlaying, like different text overlay, publishing from an accessibility point of view isn't, you know, but you don't like, what I'm saying is like, um.Yeah, like what do you think's, um, priority to fix up?I don't know. I think the things that you can control, like the buttons, definitely. Yeah. I think like making sure that that's usable is important. Um, this is looking fine. I wouldn't, I wouldn't invest too much more in this.Would you make it like, like, uh, fully transparent so that. Um, if you can, yes, but it's not like, it's not that burdening. Yeah. Right now. In terms of like in urgent-wise. Yeah.It's not that important. Um, I also don't mind seeing everything. I think that's like part of it. Yeah. Um. Yeah. Like not urgent.The weird thing is right now it reads from right to left.Like the left is the most recent. Yeah. Which I should make it fully the right most if I'm, if I'm not gonna like actually fix it up, you know what I mean?Wait, why? Wait, so the. So this one's the most recent right now. Oh, okay, okay, yeah, yeah.But I should make it the right most. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, flip that around. Um, but you think it's not worth actually like, um, like it's fine as is.Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um, oh, actually in this like view, this box, if you can make the box transparent, that would be nice though. UI, wait, can you go into a node? Like, like this thing transparent? No, this, the, the speaking box. Speaking box transparent? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because like, look, it's right now it's cutting over this channel and it just looks a bit janky. Yeah. I, it was meant to be fully transparent. It's just the fix didn't work, whatever the agent did.Yeah. Um, can you hover into like a node itself? Yeah. I just wanna see what it looks like.Yeah. This is probably a bad example. This is maybe a better one. Yeah. Um, yeah, if we can make.Oh. It's just annoying me that it's not centered. Yeah. Yeah.Um, what's, what's in the dropdown here?Like again, this is very minor random fixes. Um, cookie pop, cookie content.Yep, yeah, I'm just sending a message to her on. Okay, that's fine. That looks good. Um,wait, can you hover over one of these again?Run. Can you add the text above rather than below? Yeah. It's really small, but it'll make it clearer, more clear.Yeah. And do you have anything which is like a help or an info? You've got an info here.Yeah, currently it just, um, opens like my website, but I'll make it, I'll take it to like the, you know, help. Yeah. Part of the website.Okay, I was gonna say. Um. Yeah, let them fix that. Um, with the button on top, like do you have any right now it's too cramped.Is that sort of the reason? Yeah. L ike above it's less cramped? Yeah, well, because like you say, say you hover over a node, this one.Yeah. Last one, you've got text underneath, you've got text here. Yeah. That's cramped between here and you've got a text. Yeah. Because it's too much.The only question I have is that, is that intuitive for the, I guess it doesn't matter, right? Like the, it doesn't matter. Right now. Um, so. Because like once they use it once, they'll understand what it means, right? Yeah.And you want them to be able to read it. And because all of these nodes are the text goes down, like does it ever go above? You can't just roll back. No, no, it doesn't. Okay, so because it never goes above.Yeah. It means that you're always adding more and more text underneath, right? So like say you hover over this. Mm. And see how like there's always gonna be like a gap here. Yeah. Where you see more text.Well, above there will never be. Yeah. Text. So I'm gonna get rid of this title when you hover over it. Okay. Because this is then the source of truth for the title.Yeah, but it's still like very cramped. Like I think the, the, this margin is quite small.Oh, you know, the PR one. Yeah, so do you think I should, um, hmm. Like Yeah. Okay. So there we go. See you, James. Nice to see you.Um, okay, you've got, you've got two options, right? If you hover over it again. Yeah. Okay, you've got two options.One, is like, but see, it's, it's not just this text. Yeah. It's also like, say this text. Yeah. This one is cramming into it.Yeah, and the worst thing is this is actually the very bad case. Now you can't even see the button. Yeah, exactly.Um. So I think that's like the worst case you should try to solve.Yeah. Do you have any recommendations? Okay, wait, go back to it. Oh, see. Wait, with the, with the.I could give it like a white background.Uh, one option is that like you make it like a block. Yeah. That pops up and then it like does that make sense? Do you get what I mean by block? Menu.So like, I guess the simple fix is just like adding a background to it.Um, oh. So that you at least see it here. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no. If you make it a straight background, that's linked to the, to this, like that sits above here. Yeah. And that's in the middle, then you've got all your buttons. Mm. There. Mm.That's what I would say is the optimal one. Mm.And then when you hover over it, you can have the text underneath and it just goes onto this like little space.Wait, so there's that again when you. So say, say you've got your white background here. Yeah. You've got all your little dots here. Yeah. So you hover over a pin. Yeah. It'll say pin editor in this space here. In this, yeah. Which is really readable. Yeah. Does it make sense? Like we're extending this. Yeah, yeah.Basically. Nice, nice. I feel like that will make it like the cleanest, like block. Yeah. Right now. For now, at least. You cannot wait. You can change it later.Mm. But just to make sure that it's readable. I think that's good. That makes it quite clean. Yeah. Yeah.Um, testing the transcription panel. I'm a friend. Oh, this is funny.I have one, but it only has 11%. You're welcome to use it. Are you sure?Yeah, I don't need it. I don't need it. Use it. Thanks, boo. Yeah, I'll follow that one.That's how you're going to come up with drinks.erwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Yeah, are you going up now? Yeah, I want to go up now. Okay, I'll finish up, and I'll be there in a minute.Okay, Up, up. Drinky, drinky, boo. Drinky, boo. You can handle the rest of this, right?Okay, I'm going to keep looking at the other ones.But if we're fine, if we're happy with that, then it should be okay, right? That's fine. I mean, it's fine because.Yeah, new. I need assistance.No, I just can't get up without you. Oh. Yeah. Thanks. Oh, this one?Yeah. So I guess we can make it. Yeah, okay, I should be fine. I don't know why it's up. No, it is running. Oh, the replication is running. So it ended up passing first. It just did. Okay. It doesn't finish verifying, but I don't know if it even is a verification run for that, which is the good thing.All right, we're testing two things. One is whether the, uh, thing is scrollable—the transcription panel. Um, and the other thing is whether, um, our activity log shows up, um, left to right and gets clipped at the end. Um, cool. So yeah, let's see how that works. Um, Is it working? I don't actually know. Seems to be reasonably pretty well. So scrolling works Um,Cool. Nice. That's working perfectly. Okay, one new idea we have is the abil ity to place new nodes that have no parent in a radial circle around the most distant node currently existing in the graph.Okay, one new idea we have is the ability to place new nodes that have no parent in a radial circle around the most distant node currently existing in the graph.Okay, so the main anno ying thing with VoiceTree right now is that the layout algorithm we're using for some reason is laying out, um, disconne cted subtrees pretty much on, uh, on top of each other.Ye ah, have a look at, um, for the logic for, um, adding content to a So when Soniox after we record the text, w e, um, run it, send it to our speech-to-text server, but we also inject it into any open editor or terminal that's currently active. Um, and I just want a one-line fix-up to not send it to our text-to-tree server, um, if we're sending it to an editor. Um, but I do want to send it to the text-to-tree server if we're sending it to a terminal.Okay, so one fix I'm going to do is when we add a node to the graph, we add an animation if the content has been changed. Which is like a blue animation to indicate an append. And we want to add logic to that for only the blue animation to come up if the actual content has changed, rather than just the link has been modified. And to do that, we'll need to use similar logic to our recent nodes tab, which checks if the node content has actually changed as opposed to if the links have just changed.

# Manual Terminal Test

## Steps to test terminal input:

1. Start electron dev: `npm run electron:dev`
2. Right-click on a node
3. Select "Terminal" from context menu
4. Try typing in the terminal

## Expected behavior:
- Terminal should accept keyboard input

- Commands should execute when pressing Enter

## Current issue:
- Terminal opens but doesn't accept input
- Characters don't appear when typing
- Commands can't be executed

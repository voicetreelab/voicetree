node_id: 1000
title: Command Hover Mode for Node Editor (1000)
---
### Activates a floating, unanchored markdown editor over a node on command-hover, disappearing on mouse-out.

When the command button is held and the mouse hovers over a node, a floating markdown editor should open in absolute positioning, without anchoring, so it does not move the graph. The floating window editor should disappear when the mouse moves away from it.

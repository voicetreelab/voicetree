uh, so we did markdown editor convers ion to code mirror? Um, and that seems to have worked in the tests.we're getting one editor, uh, error when we actually launch um, voice tree um, with npm run electron. Um, so we're just going to want to figure out what that is coming from.Alright, so we want to create a, um, command hover mode. So when we hold the command button, and hover over node, it should open the, um, floating window markdown editor. Um, but without an anchoring node, um, so it should just hover over the node, uh, in absolute positioning. Uh, so it doesn't need to move the graph or any of that. Um, and, um, when you move your mouse away from the, uh, floating window, um, it should disappear. Uh, so it should just close the, uh, floating window editor.Cool, the next thing we want to do is, um, if we, uh, press space, um, or if we're holding space, um, I want to, um, fit to the, uh, last node, um, created on the graph.How was your day at the office?Hey, I like to take the temperature of the room.

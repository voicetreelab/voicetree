# Core Principles

The fundamental principles that guide this system:

## 1. Simplicity

Keep things simple and maintainable. See [[architecture]] for how this is implemented.

## 2. Modularity

Components should be loosely coupled. The [[api-design]] reflects this principle.

## 3. Testability

Every component should be testable in isolation. Our [[../projects/testing-strategy]] outlines this approach.

## 4. Documentation

Clear documentation is essential. This connects to [[introduction]] as the starting point.

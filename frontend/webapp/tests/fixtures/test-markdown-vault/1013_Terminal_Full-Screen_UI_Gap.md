title: Terminal Full-Screen UI Gap (1013)
---
### Plugin for terminal full-screen mode exists, but a UI button to activate it is missing.

For terminals, I think we added the plugin, but we don't yet have a way of actually clicking full-screen. Like, there's no button to actually make it full-screen.

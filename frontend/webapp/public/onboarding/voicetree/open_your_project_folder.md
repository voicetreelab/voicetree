# Open Your Project Folder

Open Your Project Folder

Use the File > 'Open Folder', or the button in the bottom left to open any project folder. 

This will be the folder agents are launched in by default (customizable in settings). The vault suffix defaults to /voicetree, this is the folder storing .md files for graph nodes.

To visualize your existing markdown notes as an interactive graph, open the folder, and remove the default voicetree vault suffix.

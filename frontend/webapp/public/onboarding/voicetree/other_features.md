# Other Features

### Navigation
- Hold **space** to follow most recent node

- Recent nodes also appear in the top left

- There is also a minimap in the bottom right

- Agent/Terminal tabs appear in the top right


### File Syncing
Markdown files are only read and written to the vault folder you have specified in the bottom left corner.

i.e. {project_dir}/{vault_folder}

agents will spawn by default in {project_dir}, but you can change this in the settings, for example to "../../" so that agents spawn two directories above your project. 

### Settings
All settings are currently contained in the settings.json file (`~/Library/Application\ Support/VoiceTree/settings.json`) 

You can open the editor for this file in the floating menu on the right hand side of the graph.

### Agents
All prompts and commands for running agents can be modified in the settings.

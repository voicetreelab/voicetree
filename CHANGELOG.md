## Architectural Evolution (December 2024)

**c7b6bc4** - **Day 3: TreeManager Interface Implementation** - Implemented TreeManagerInterface on ContextualTreeManager as part of Bible-compliant architectural evolution. Added interface inheritance with TreeManagerInterface and TreeManagerMixin, fixed nodes_to_update to use proper interface property pattern (_nodes_to_update private attribute), maintained all existing functionality with zero behavior changes. Created comprehensive Day 3 validation test suite (3 tests) confirming interface compliance including constructor patterns, method signatures, and TreeManagerMixin functionality. All integration tests remain passing, demonstrating successful evolution of existing structure rather than replacement.

**Previous commits** - **Requirements Consolidation & Documentation Cleanup** - Consolidated dual requirements system (requirements.txt + requirements_unified.txt) into single comprehensive requirements.txt with organized dependencies and resolved version conflicts. Removed duplicate backend/agentic_workflows/requirements.txt and updated CI/CD workflows. Completely rewrote ARCHITECTURE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md replacing fictional "Mission Accomplished" claims with honest current state documentation, clear north star architecture vision, and Bible-compliant micro-evolution roadmap. Fixed failing tests and system health issues, established green state maintenance throughout evolution process.

## Recent Commits

**1a98dfd** - This commit significantly expanded the testing infrastructure and development workflow. Added comprehensive integration tests including `test_full_system_integration.py` (324 lines) for end-to-end system testing and `test_manual_workflow.py` (170 lines) for manual workflow testing capabilities. Created a new system verification script `verify_system.py` to help validate system functionality. Enhanced the development workflow by adding several cursor rules files for problem-solving strategies and git commit practices. Updated the GitHub Actions workflow configuration with 34 additional lines to improve CI/CD pipeline reliability. Removed the legacy `test_audio_integration.py` file (99 lines) as it was superseded by the new comprehensive integration test suite. Overall, this commit added over 500 lines of new test code while cleaning up outdated tests and improving development practices.

**3b9f004** - Added the `faster-whisper` dependency to the requirements.txt file to enable faster and more efficient audio processing capabilities in the test suite. This change supports the new audio processing integration tests and improves the overall performance of audio-related functionality in the system.

**0e5b1fd** - Modified the GitHub Actions workflow configuration to trigger the CI/CD pipeline on any Python file changes (`**/*.py`) or GitHub workflow file changes (`.github/**`). This change improves the responsiveness of the continuous integration system by ensuring tests run whenever relevant code or workflow files are modified, providing faster feedback during development cycles.

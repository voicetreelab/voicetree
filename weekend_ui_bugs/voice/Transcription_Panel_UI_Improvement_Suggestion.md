# Transcription Panel UI Improvement Suggestion

### Suggests rounding the square edges of the blurness/opaqueness in the transcription panel UI for a less harsh and better aesthetic.

Um, I wonder UI wise, so in the transcription panel of our transcri be text, we have this sort of, um, blurness or opaqueness. Um, and I wonder if we can make the edges of that rounded so it's less harsh because currently it's just square, which can look a little bit strange. It could look better if, if it was rounded edges, of the blur.

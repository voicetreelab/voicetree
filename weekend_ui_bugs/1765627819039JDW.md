when we record speech into Markdown editors, 

currently the transcription just gets inserted directly into the floating editor. But instead, what we want to do is we want to have some sort of like floating thing that will appear that will indicate that we can now, um, but there's text that you recorded that you can be put into the Markdown document directly. Um, and enter would actually add it and cap and delet uh, or escape would, um, just not let it go into the editor.Um, and, and just remove the tooltip. 

what is best ux/ ui wise here? first do u understand what I mean

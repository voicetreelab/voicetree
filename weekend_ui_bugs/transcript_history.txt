Um, I wonder UI wise, so in the transcription panel of our transcri be text, we have this sort of, um, blurness or opaqueness. Um, and I wonder if we can make the edges of that rounded so it's l ess harsh because currently it's just square,which can look a little bit strange. It could look better if, if it was rounded edges, of the blur.So I do wonder, will we still send to the server if we press no? Seems like that perhaps didn't work.So yeah, it seems like it's a little bit buggy, perhaps. Um, especially when, um, we do, um, yeah, I don't actually know.Yeah, I'm not sure if it should clear on click.Yeah, it's pressing cancel also working?Yeah, so I'm not actu ally sure if we have a bug where the text, if we don't let it come up in the preview chip, if it instead, um, will send to server.

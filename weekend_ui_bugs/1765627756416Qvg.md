# we have a bug

### UI suffix disappears when null or empty; should show an empty value instead.

When the suffix for watch directory is null or empty, um, the suffix in the bottom left UI just disappears. Um, instead, it should just, uh, show like something to indicate, but there's no content. Um, just like, um, some like empty value or something. Instead of disappearing the whole element.

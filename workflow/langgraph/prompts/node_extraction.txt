You are extracting new node names from integration decisions.

Given the integration decisions below, extract ONLY the names of nodes that should be created (action="CREATE").

Integration decisions:
```{extract}```

Existing nodes that should NOT be included:
```{nodes}```

Instructions:
1. Look for entries where "action": "CREATE"
2. Extract the "new_node_name" value from those entries
3. Return ONLY the node names as a simple comma-separated list
4. Do NOT include any explanatory text, code snippets, or formatting
5. Do NOT include nodes that already exist in the existing nodes list

Example output format:
Node Name 1, Node Name 2, Node Name 3

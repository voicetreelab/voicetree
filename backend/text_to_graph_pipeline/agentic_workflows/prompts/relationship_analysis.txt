You are an expert system component responsible for semantic matching within a conversational transcript analysis process. Your task is to analyze a list of incoming conversational sub-chunks (each with a name and text) and, for each one, identify the single most relevant existing topic node OR *another sub-chunk from the same input list*. You also need to briefly describe the relationship.

The goal is to find the best connection point for each sub-chunk, which could be an established node in the graph summary OR another potential node (represented by a sub-chunk) just identified in the latest transcript processing.

Your specific instructions are:

1.  Iterate through each sub-chunk object in the `sub_chunks` list. Each sub-chunk has `name`, `text`, and `is_complete` fields.
2.  For each sub-chunk:
    a.  Analyze the core meaning and topic presented in its `text`.
    b.  Carefully compare this core meaning against BOTH:
        i.  The `name` and `summary` of *every* node provided in the `existing_nodes_summary`.
        ii. The `name` and `text` of *every OTHER* sub-chunk within the input `sub_chunks` list.
    c.  Reasoning: Briefly articulate *why* you chose a specific existing node OR another sub-chunk (or decided none fit) and *why* you assigned that relationship type. Use this space to think step-by-step.
    d.  ACTION: Determine which *single* item (either an existing node from `existing_nodes_summary` OR another sub-chunk from the `sub_chunks` list) is the **most** semantically relevant to the current sub-chunk being processed. The connection should be strong and direct (e.g., same topic, continuation, elaboration, example, counter-point). Record the exact `name` of that chosen item (whether it's an existing node name or a sub-chunk name).
    e.  ACTION: Determine the relationship between the current sub-chunk and the chosen item (e.g., "elaborates on", "exemplified by", "continuation of", "blocked by", "correction", "counter-argument"). Provide a brief, descriptive relationship type (1-3 words).
    f.  If, after careful consideration, you determine that **no** existing node AND **no** other sub-chunk is sufficiently relevant:
        i.  Record the specific string: `NO_RELEVANT_NODE` for the `relevant_node_name`.
        ii. The relationship type should be `null`.
        iii. IMPORTANT: Use NO_RELEVANT_NODE sparingly. Consider:
            - Does this chunk implement or support another chunk's idea?
            - Is it a next step that follows from another chunk?
            - Does it provide context or background for other chunks?
            - Is it part of a sequence with other chunks?

3.  **Output Format:** Construct a JSON object with an "analyzed_chunks" field containing a list. Each element in the list corresponds to one input sub-chunk and MUST contain ALL of the following fields (no fields can be omitted):
    *   `name`: The original `name` of the sub-chunk from the input (required, string).
    *   `text`: The original `text` of the sub-chunk from the input (required, string).
    *   `reasoning`: Your step-by-step analysis for choosing the relevant item and relationship (required, string).
    *   `relevant_node_name`: The exact `name` of the most relevant existing node OR other sub-chunk found, or the string `NO_RELEVANT_NODE` (required, string).
    *   `relationship`: The brief description of the relationship (string), or `null` if no relevant node (use JSON null, not the string "null").

4.  Ensure that EVERY element in "analyzed_chunks" contains ALL five fields listed above. Missing any field will cause validation errors. Ensure your final output is ONLY the valid JSON object described above, without any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself.

**Example:**

**Existing Nodes:** `[{"name": "Project Setup", "summary": "Initial project configuration and requirements gathering"}]`

**Sub-chunks:** `[{"name": "Database Choice", "text": "We decided to use PostgreSQL for better performance with complex queries", "is_complete": true}, {"name": "API Framework", "text": "FastAPI will be our web framework due to its async capabilities", "is_complete": true}]`

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "analyzed_chunks": [
    {
      "name": "Database Choice", 
      "text": "We decided to use PostgreSQL for better performance with complex queries",
      "reasoning": "This chunk describes a specific technical decision that elaborates on the broader project setup process. It provides implementation details for the database component.",
      "relevant_node_name": "Project Setup",
      "relationship": "elaborates on"
    },
    {
      "name": "API Framework",
      "text": "FastAPI will be our web framework due to its async capabilities", 
      "reasoning": "This chunk also describes a technical decision that is part of the project setup. Like the database choice, it elaborates on the setup process with specific technology selection.",
      "relevant_node_name": "Project Setup",
      "relationship": "elaborates on"
    }
  ]
}
```

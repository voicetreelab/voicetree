Task: Refactor the provided node's content into an optimal structure.

The optimal structure is the one that maximizes Cognitive Efficiency, defined as (Meaning Preserved) / (Cognitive Cost).

Your goal is to find the equilibrium between two competing costs:

    Structural Cost: Avoid over-fragmenting into too many nodes, which makes the graph difficult to navigate.

    Nodal Cost: Avoid packing too many distinct ideas into one node, which overloads working memory.

First, synthesize all provided content into a single, integrated understanding. Then, refactor this unified content to maximize Cognitive Efficiency

To achieve this, make each new or updated node represent a single, cohesive Conceptual Unit: a distinct idea (like a task, decision, observation that can be named and understood on its own. Do not create new nodes for concepts that already exist as neighbors; reference them instead.

Justify your final structure by explaining how it maximizes cognitive efficiency, referencing the trade-off between structural and nodal cost.

Since you cannot modify existing neighbor nodes, follow the reference-over-duplication rule:

- If a neighbor already covers a concept, reference it rather than creating a duplicate concept. Organize content to reference neighbors, making the overall structure more concise. When neighbors contain related concepts, structure your content to point to the appropriate existing node rather than re-explaining


**Contents of the node to optimize:**
- Node Name: {{node_name}}
- Node Summary: {{node_summary}}
- Node Content: {{node_content}}
- Neighbors: {{neighbors}}

Match two orphans with previous name.


If you are creating an orphan, provide a concept name for the orphan (orphan_topic_name). This name should be specific.

For example, an orphan text segment "The average number of newborn children per adult naumann's elephant in Lustrous Catacombs equals the difference between the average number of newborn children per adult crow in South Zoo and the number of adult crow in South Zoo."

Should have orphan name A = "Equation for Newborn children per adult naumann's elephant in Lustrous Catacombs"

This orphan_topic_name, now becomes a VALID target node for future segments. However, since this node hasn't actually been created yet, we will treat future segments targeting this also like orphans, and just specify the exact same orphan_topic_name.

If you propose a new topic, you MUST explain in your reasoning field why NO existing nodes were a suitable match.
In addition, add "There is not a single possibly related node", in your reasoning, if this is the case, (and if this statement is contradictory, we have made a mistake somewhere!).

Your final output will now either be, a target node (ID & name), or a new topic name for the orphan.

You are extracting new node names from integration decisions.

Given the integration decisions below, extract ONLY the names of nodes that should be created (action="CREATE").

Integration decisions:
```{extract}```

Existing nodes that should NOT be included:
```{nodes}```

Instructions:
1. Look for entries where "action": "CREATE"
2. Extract the "new_node_name" value from those entries
3. Return ONLY the node names as a simple comma-separated list
4. Do NOT include any explanatory text, code snippets, or formatting
5. Do NOT include nodes that already exist in the existing nodes list

**Example:**

**Integration decisions:**
```
[
  {{"name": "Meeting Setup", "action": "APPEND", "target_node": "Project Planning", "new_node_name": null}},
  {{"name": "Database Design", "action": "CREATE", "target_node": "Technical Architecture", "new_node_name": "Database Schema"}},
  {{"name": "User Authentication", "action": "CREATE", "target_node": "Security Requirements", "new_node_name": "Login System"}}
]
```

**Existing nodes:** `["Project Planning", "Technical Architecture", "Security Requirements"]`

**Expected output:** `Database Schema, Login System`

Example output format:
Node Name 1, Node Name 2, Node Name 3

A new form of TDD.

Where the first priority is defining our high level test cases. The behaviours we want our code to do.
We can work together with the agent to do this.

This is the most important step, defining what we actually want.

high level testing strategy should mostly be written by human, ask agent for clarifying questions, and to challenge & provide critique.

The initial idea with the architecture here was that we could have the abstraction of an agent, which is just
nodes (prompt template w input variables)
edges (data flow from output prompts) which have
    - transformers ( modify data in beetween nodes) i.e. map from output format
of one node to input format of the other. Doesn't have to be completely
side-effect free to allow for lots of powerful things in the future

this can also be called prompts + prompt_relatinoships e.g. see backend/text_to_graph_pipeline/agentic_workflows/agents/tree-action-decider-agent

everything else here is just to make that abstraction actually work

in the future we want to be able to quickly add a new agent
just by describing the prompts & dataflow between them.

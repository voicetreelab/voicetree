Okay, git checkout main
And now let's see
If we have...
Sure verse.
Okay, here we have it
okay so now we want to make sure that this
Scripts, we found it.
um
Um...
Let's also load the latest
Um...
So let's go
Build.
And then let's go.
Um, okay.
So, I think, did we just run films?
160
Reload juggle.
So we have now this
tool.
Um...
graph dependency traversal and now let's say find where we use it
Okay.
Okay, let's restart my computer.
I'll see you next time.
You
Thank you.
Okay, let's end this.
Hallihallo!
Hey, I'm doing, um,
Recordings.
Let's go.
What do you want to do though?
No, I was um, I just stopped my recording, but I'm doing a cool recording like this
Oh, cool.
Can I have a look?
That's what it looks like.
Well, it keeps on flickering. Can you turn my phone on?
I think it's out of battery.
It does not go on? No, it's okay.
Mm-hmm.
I'll see you next time.
Hmm
Okay, and then let's have the logs there, so.
All righty. Okay, so let's see.
if it can now understand that there's a tree loading integration.
can that we just built
So we want to understand if that works.
So
Let's see, creating a new node.
Hmm.
All right, so we've just
Um,
So we just added functionality to the load in existing tree.
We want to see if that works now.
So tree loading integration
access that node
Hmm, okay, let's look at...
Voice tree.log
Alright, did we just...
Mark down.
3 volt
What the fuck is going on?
let's see ready to listen
I have you loaded
loading tree.
Loaded 18 months.
I love you.
Okay, so we should be able to just add that there.
Okay, so we want both a logging and a print statement.
Okay, that should be sufficient.
Okay, cool. Now it's working
So if we're talking about the tree loading integrator.
can it add a new node there?
Um...
Let's see
Yeah, awesome. Okay, that's pretty cool.
Alright, so that's first feature done.
Let's just check the video.
All righty, that is done. Okay, so cool now we can actually work on voice stream. So we had
Um...
What did we have? We were going on a couple of things.
Oh, yeah, the two problems with voice.
So we want to work on the terminal default height issue.
And the, um,
graph flickering issue.
Um...
So...
Let's work on the Terminal Default Height issue.
because that's going to be easy.
Thank you.
Okay, so if we open
A terminal here now.
Cool.
Oh, actually.
Before we do that, we.
Um...
We wanted to look at if we could.
Let's hide some of that
All right
Hide.
All right, so we wanted to see
Um...
So we did that
And now we wanted to see.
Okay, so that worked, cool.
We can...
Clear that node
Okay, so we have demo complete.
Um...
Okay, so...
What do I actually want to do right now?
Um...
Oh, yeah, okay, so we were working on...
the ability to do a graph traversal search.
So that's this graph dependency traversal tool.
So if we open that up...
And we can run Claude.
Okay, and then...
let's make that a little bit bigger
Um...
Um, okay, so...
We have a tool
Voice
Tree
Oh, okay
So graph.
Get a tool for this.
Um...
What do you want to do now?
So we want.
So what do we want actually to happen?
Whenever you open
from a node.
We want to do a graph.
On that node to its parent
So up through its dependencies.
One second.
Hello?
Okay, I hope it's time to go to the side.
Where are you at?
All right, we just had a packet come.
um so yeah what do we actually want to do regarding the
dependency traversal tool.
Um...
So...
Um, we want...
Returning only seven nodes from select-
Why would that be?
Oh, because...
Right. Nothing was relevant.
Hello?
links
Sorry, we're still Orbin or...
Oben oder unten?
Unten.
Robin, okay, I'm going to go to the right side.
Thank you.
Oh man, fucking door.
Um,
Right, so...
What do we want to do we want
Um...
when
So instead of just getting the parents' content...
we want to give the full graph dependency traversal.
So, currently...
when we open Claude.
Oh, come on.
When we...
Okay, so in...
markdown tree vault, add new node.
No, here.
Demo prompt dot wait
Ah, okay, so.
Um...
So we have currently in.
We just load
So we have pump is.
Doom.
Wait.
If you want.
Injected in this prompt to be the full.
I propose a way to do this.
Okay, so I'm running an agent
right now on
So that's running.
Okay, and now I realize that
Um...
when the graph moves
Sometimes the terminal isn't moving.
Do that. That seems to work
But I guess if it happens while it's moving.
Um...
Okay.
So let's see what's decided to do
Okay, so now let's
open
A Gemini instant.
Um...
So
We are getting lost in the tree a bit too easily.
That is one problem because things just sort of flicker around too much, which is...
The second problem we need to...
Okay, so...
Let's um
delete that
So we have here and here
And now we want to go Gemini.
Okay.
And let's get it to review that.
so this is
forward dependency graph traversal into cloud SH.
Let me see, review this.
proposed
navigate to
All right, let's get more.
Okay.
And now let's go.
Opus to work on that.
and say,
review this
this
Also look at the neighbors.
So this does make me think that we're all
have to be able to see
Oh my god.
So annoying zoom.
Um...
So let's see
Um, okay, so...
There's a problem here with the markdown.
Let's, let's get, uh, do it. Okay.
Thanks.
Make sure they're known.
problems with this.
And then exit.
So this guy's saying that the clod is
the build is failing.
So when you figure out why the builds
And what does he actually change?
No, we don't want that.
So let's say no
Shut the man.
So we can't reference files easily
Um...
Yeah, it is a problem. Voice trademarked entry vault.
I'm going to guess. Oh well.
Okay, so let's test if that works.
um so we can
So we can open up a terminal here.
Claude.
Let me see, do the same for Gemini.
And then we want to see.
Um.
There you go.
Enhanced.
So we want to loop.
Okay.
You
I'll see you next time.
Okay, let's see this guy.
Okay, let's see what this guy did
Don't want that action.
Do you need to be able to specify a...
folder for it to work in.
Um...
So maybe
We could do like...
I don't know.
Claude sh
Folder like that
It's not a bad idea
Okay, cool. So now we want to work on a new task.
Um, actually, let me just see if I can open it.
Okay, that did actually work.
Okay.
The flickering is really annoying.

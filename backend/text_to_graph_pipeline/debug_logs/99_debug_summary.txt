WORKFLOW DEBUG SUMMARY - 16:48:25
==========================================

Available Debug Logs:
  - 00_transcript_input.txt (411 bytes)
  - test_debug.txt (223 bytes)
  - test_llm_io.txt (288 bytes)

Total Debug Files: 3

To investigate the workflow issue:

1. Start with 00_transcript_input.txt to see ALL transcript inputs (logs accumulate across runs)
2. Check segmentation_debug.txt to see if chunks are correct
3. Check relationship_analysis_debug.txt to see if relationships are found
4. Check integration_decision_debug.txt to see if decisions make sense

NOTE: Debug logs now accumulate across multiple runs. Look for separator lines
with timestamps to distinguish between different executions.

Look for where the content starts to diverge from the original transcript.

2025-07-12 15:36:30 | VoiceTree Original | 4d56c9c772 | 2/5 (Poor) | The system struggles significantly with creating a coherent structure, resulting in fragmented nodes, redundancy, and numerous illogical connections between otherwise accurately captured concepts.
2025-07-12 15:46:26 | VoiceTree Original | 45af8621d1 | 3/5 (Acceptable) | The system's main weakness is significant node fragmentation and redundancy, which splits single, coherent ideas into multiple, less meaningful nodes and hurts the overall clarity of the tree.
2025-07-12 15:51:11 | VoiceTree Original | 45af8621d1 | 4/5 (Good) | The system excels at identifying relevant topics and establishing logical hierarchies, but its primary weakness is node fragmentation, where single concepts are split into multiple, overly granular nodes, impacting conciseness.
2025-07-12 16:45:00 | VoiceTree Original | a0d47c48e8 | 2/5 (Poor) | The system creates a logically coherent but severely incomplete and fragmented tree, failing to capture the majority of the key technical considerations and decisions discussed in the transcript.
2025-07-12 16:50:47 | VoiceTree Original | a0d47c48e8 | 4/5 (Good) | The system creates a highly logical and well-structured tree but fails to capture the entire transcript, leading to significant missing information.
2025-07-12 17:21:36 | VoiceTree Original | d705649ab4 | 2/5 (Poor) | The system struggles to create a coherent and logical tree structure, resulting in circular references, illogical hierarchies, and poorly defined, disconnected nodes.
2025-07-12 17:31:14 | VoiceTree Original | d705649ab4 | 3/5 (Acceptable) | The system's main weaknesses are node fragmentation, which separates closely related ideas into different files, and incompleteness, as it missed the final points of the transcript.
2025-07-12 17:42:07 | VoiceTree Original | d705649ab4 | 4/5 (Good) | The system's main area for improvement is in consolidating conversational filler and minor points into more substantial nodes to reduce fragmentation and redundancy.
2025-07-12 17:44:07 | VoiceTree Original | d705649ab4 | 4/5 (Good) | The system excels at creating concise, relevant nodes and accurately identifying key concepts, but it slightly falters by missing a key parent-child relationship, which affects the overall structural coherence.
2025-07-12 17:53:55 | VoiceTree Original | 0b45d7e858 | 3/5 (Acceptable) | The system creates a logically ordered but flattened structure that misses key details and fails to establish proper parent-child relationships, resulting in a list rather than a true content tree.
2025-07-12 18:03:29 | VoiceTree Original | 0b45d7e858 | 3/5 (Acceptable) | The system's primary weakness is its failure to properly summarize concepts into distinct nodes, leading to redundancy, fragmentation, and the omission of key information.
2025-07-12 18:09:36 | VoiceTree Original | 0b45d7e858 | 4/5 (Good) | The system creates a logically sound and well-structured tree but needs improvement in capturing all details from the transcript and refining its node content.
2025-07-12 18:14:24 | VoiceTree Original | 0b45d7e858 | 3.0/5 (Acceptable) | The system's biggest weakness is in creating a coherent and logical tree structure, with several incorrect parent-child relationships and a fragmented representation of the main plan.
2025-07-12 18:41:08 | VoiceTree Original | 4f512ca5d7 | 3.2/5 (Acceptable) | The system's biggest weakness is its method of segmenting and summarizing nodes, which relies too heavily on raw transcript phrases, leading to incoherent node content and the omission of key details.
2025-07-12 20:47:03 | VoiceTree Original | c351e67ba2 | 3.0/5 (Acceptable) | The system successfully identifies most key topics but struggles significantly with establishing coherent and logical relationships between them, resulting in a fragmented and sometimes illogical tree structure.
2025-07-12 22:52:54 | VoiceTree Original | c351e67ba2 | 3.3/5 (Acceptable) | The system needs to improve its ability to consolidate closely related ideas into single nodes and establish logically sound relationships, as demonstrated by the fragmented 'Proof of Concept' node and the broken link for the 'Flutter' node.
2025-07-12 23:13:54 | VoiceTree Original | 1065c144da | 3.8/5 (Good) | The system's primary weakness is in Node Structure, where it sometimes combines distinct steps into a single node, and in its failure to capture the entire transcript, slightly impacting accuracy.
2025-07-12 23:17:11 | VoiceTree Original | 1065c144da | 3.3/5 (Acceptable) | The system's primary weakness is in maintaining coherent, bi-directional links between nodes and its tendency to create overly fragmented nodes that lack sufficient context.
2025-07-12 23:23:05 | VoiceTree Original | 1065c144da | 3.7/5 (Good) | The system's primary weakness is in establishing correct hierarchical relationships, leading to a flawed logical structure despite an excellent separation of individual ideas.
2025-07-12 23:25:30 | VoiceTree Original | 1065c144da | 3.7/5 (Good) | The biggest areas for improvement are in the fine-grained separation of concepts into distinct nodes and the accuracy of some hierarchical relationships.
2025-07-13 12:20:08 | VoiceTree Original | c3d8a0e912 | 4.0/5 (Good) | The system needs improvement in creating concise nodes by merging redundant statements and generating more effective, abstract summaries for node titles instead of using direct quotes.
2025-07-13 12:26:54 | VoiceTree Original | c3d8a0e912 | 4.0/5 (Good) | The system's primary weakness is in generating relevant and complete titles for the nodes, often selecting transitional phrases or incomplete sentences instead of the core concept.
2025-07-13 12:46:40 | Ilan Original | 1cc1f7ba55 | 1.5/5 (Poor) | The system's primary failure is its inability to create a hierarchical tree structure, resulting in a single, large, and unfocused node that does not organize the transcript's key concepts.
2025-07-13 13:01:13 | Ilan Original | 1cc1f7ba55 | 1.5/5 (Poor) | The biggest areas for improvement are the fundamental tree structure, which is incoherent and fragmented, and the extreme redundancy and poor topic separation within the nodes.
2025-07-13 13:01:36 | Ilan Original | 1cc1f7ba55 | 2.0/5 (Poor) | The system's output is critically undermined by extreme content redundancy and a fundamentally flawed node structure, which combines unrelated ideas into a broken root node while creating other, overly fragmented nodes.
2025-07-13 13:11:50 | Ilan Original | 1cc1f7ba55 | 1.8/5 (Poor) | The biggest areas for improvement are establishing a logical tree structure with meaningful relationships between nodes and ensuring all key information and context from the transcript are captured.
2025-07-13 13:24:08 | Ilan Original | d7dceb9bfc | 2.2/5 (Poor) | The system fails to create a meaningful "tree" by omitting any relationships between nodes, and it captures only small, incomplete fragments of the conversation, missing the core context and flow.
2025-07-13 13:27:02 | Ilan Original | d7dceb9bfc | 1.7/5 (Poor) | The system fails to create a coherent tree structure, instead producing a flat list of poorly-defined nodes that mash together distinct topics and omit critical information.
2025-07-13 13:34:15 | Ilan Original | d7dceb9bfc | 2.2/5 (Poor) | The biggest areas for improvement are the fundamental node structure, which combines multiple distinct topics into a single incoherent node, and the accuracy of node titles and content.
2025-07-13 13:50:21 | VT Original | e25d93d92b | 2.7/5 (Poor-to-Acceptable) | The system's primary weakness is its failure to create a correct hierarchical structure, incorrectly representing sub-tasks of the "Proof of Concept" as independent, top-level topics.
2025-07-13 14:00:34 | VT Original | 42e61f093b | 3.7/5 (Good) | The system's primary area for improvement is in how it defines the boundaries of a node, which leads to both redundant nodes for a single idea and overly consolidated nodes for multiple ideas.

Hey YC, I'm Manu the founder of VoiceTree.

Today's LLMs essentially simulate memory through brute force: they re-process the whole chat history and context for every single turn. This is efficient.

VoiceTree solves this at the input layer. We convert any unstructured text into a losslessly compressed graph. On the GSM-infinite benchmark, this delivers 70% fewer tokens and 15% greater reasoning accuracy.

What we then discovered is that this graph itself is the perfect interface for interacting with AI: a shared memory between humans and AI.

I'll show you what I mean.

 This demo is running on our core API, structuring my voice into that shared graph right now.

 I'll now add an agent into our shared workspace.

 It gets the exact context it needs from the graph. It’s cheaper and more accurate, I don't need to re-explain it any context, its progress is visible to me in real-time.

This workspace is the first product built on our core API: a new, structured primitive for building with AI.

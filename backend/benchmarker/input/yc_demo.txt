Hey I'm Manu, and I've been busy building software that unlocks a new system for human AI collaboration.

This system is centered around our core algorithm called VoiceTree, which converts text streams, such as a live voice, into a tree representation, similar to a mind map. It's running right now live.

What's the benefit of this? The tree allows for a more efficient representation of content, decreasing cognitive load by providing a memory aid for the high-level concepts and the relationships between them rather than getting lost in the detail.

As we'll see soon, both humans and LLMs can benefit from this.
On top of the VoiceTree platform, so much is possible. We have so far focused on two breakthrough use cases.

The first is an interface for software engineers to manage multiple coding agents.
The second is improving agents themselves through compressing and better representing their context with VoiceTree.

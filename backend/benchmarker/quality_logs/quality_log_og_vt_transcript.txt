2025-07-30 11:26:43 | VT Original Test 2 | 5108d9d922 | 4.2/5 (Good) | The tree's biggest area for improvement is establishing a complete hierarchy by linking the main project initiation node to its primary sub-task, the proof of concept.
2025-07-30 11:29:35 | VT Original Test 2 | 5108d9d922 | 3.7/5 (Good) | The biggest area for improvement is in establishing complete and navigable relationships between nodes, specifically by adding links from parent nodes to their children.
2025-07-31 11:32:23 | VT Original Transcript | f6843ab866 | 4.5/5 (Excellent) | The biggest area for improvement is reducing redundancy within individual nodes, where a summary paragraph often repeats the detailed points listed immediately below it.
2025-07-31 11:43:29 | VT Original Transcript | 0ba24b5c79 | 4.2/5 (Good) | The biggest area for improvement is in conciseness, as the system created two separate, redundant nodes for the audio streaming challenge instead of merging them into one.
2025-07-31 11:49:03 | VT Original Transcript | 0ba24b5c79 | 4.3/5 (Good) | The biggest area for improvement is in the high-level grouping of topics, as some distinct ideas from the transcript were combined into a single, less-focused parent node, slightly compromising coherence.
2025-07-31 11:59:54 | VT Original Transcript | 0ba24b5c79 | 3.0/5 (Acceptable) | The tree's biggest areas for improvement are significant node redundancy and an illogical structure, particularly in how it separates the main Proof of Concept idea into two overlapping nodes and combines/separates the Flutter topic.
2025-07-31 12:14:26 | VT Original Transcript | 0ba24b5c79 | 3.3/5 (Acceptable) | The biggest areas for improvement are ensuring all nodes are correctly linked into the main tree structure and refining the hierarchy to better distinguish between parallel project goals and sub-tasks.

2025-07-30 11:19:52 | VT Clustering | 5108d9d922 | 4.2/5 (Good) | The biggest area for improvement is in reducing redundancy by merging overly fragmented nodes that repeat the same information.
2025-07-30 11:23:19 | VT Clustering | 5108d9d922 | 4.0/5 (Good) | The primary area for improvement is in conciseness; the tree should merge nodes that contain redundant or nearly identical information to create a more efficient structure.
2025-07-30 11:24:49 | VT Clustering Test 1 | 5108d9d922 | 1.5/5 (Poor) | The system's primary failure is its inability to create a tree structure, instead producing a single, monolithic node that simply contains the raw transcript without any logical separation or relationships.
2025-07-30 11:27:41 | VT Clustering Test 1 | 5108d9d922 | 1.5/5 (Poor) | The system's primary failure is its inability to create a tree structure, instead producing a single, unstructured node that includes redundant placeholder text and omits key information from the transcript.
2025-07-30 11:32:11 | VT Clustering | 5108d9d922 | 3.5/5 (Good) | The tree's structure could be improved by correcting key hierarchical relationships and merging redundant nodes to enhance overall coherence.
2025-07-30 11:53:07 | VT Clustering | 5108d9d922 | 3.7/5 (Good) | The biggest areas for improvement are in reducing redundancy by merging duplicated concepts and correcting the hierarchical relationships for concluding nodes, which are often incorrectly linked to the root.
2025-07-30 14:02:28 | VT Clustering | 5108d9d922 | 2.8/5 (Acceptable) | The biggest areas for improvement are in reducing node redundancy by merging concepts spoken about together, and in improving the accuracy and logical coherence of the relationships between nodes.
2025-07-31 11:36:09 | VT Clustering | f6843ab866 | 3.3/5 (Acceptable/Good) | The biggest areas for improvement are in establishing accurate causal relationships between nodes and consolidating redundant or fragmented information into more concise, well-defined nodes.
2025-07-31 11:46:58 | VT Clustering | 0ba24b5c79 | 1.2/5 (Unusable) | The system's primary weakness is its complete failure to create a multi-node tree structure, resulting in a single, overly general node that omits nearly all specific details from the transcript.
2025-07-31 12:03:20 | VT Clustering | 0ba24b5c79 | 3.7/5 (Good) | The system's biggest area for improvement is in establishing correct logical and causal parent-child relationships, as several key nodes are incorrectly linked, which breaks the core narrative flow of the problem-solution story.

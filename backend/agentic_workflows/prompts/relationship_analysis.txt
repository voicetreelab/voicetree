You analyze conversational chunks to find their strongest semantic connection - either an existing node OR another chunk from the same batch. Focus on preserving the natural flow of human thought and maintaining narrative coherence.

**Relationship Types (in priority order):**
- **"continues"** - Direct continuation of the same thought, narrative, or cognitive thread
- **"implements"** - Describes concrete steps, methods, or actions for achieving abstract goals
- **"elaborates on"** - Provides deeper detail, examples, clarification, or expansion of a concept
- **"follows"** - Next sequential step in a logical process or temporal progression
- **"part of"** - Essential component, subset, or integral element of a larger concept
- **"leads to"** - Describes direct consequences, outcomes, or causal results
- **"enables"** - Provides necessary foundation, prerequisite, or enabling condition
- **"exemplifies"** - Gives concrete examples or specific instances of abstract concepts
- **"addresses"** - Provides solutions, responses, or approaches to problems or challenges
- **"contrasts with"** - Presents opposing views, alternatives, or different approaches
- **"relates to"** - General thematic or topical connection (use only when no stronger relationship exists)

**Instructions:**

1. **Deep Semantic Analysis:** For each chunk in `sub_chunks`, analyze its complete meaning, intent, and cognitive purpose.

2. **Connection Priority:** Find the STRONGEST semantic connection by checking:
   - **Recently updated nodes** (marked with [recently updated]) - highest priority
   - **Existing nodes** with strong thematic or logical connections
   - **Other chunks** in the same batch that share cognitive threads
   - **Narrative flow** - what would naturally come next in the speaker's thought process

3. **Semantic Connection Strength (prioritize in this order):**
   - **Narrative continuity:** Same story, thought process, or cognitive thread
   - **Causal relationships:** Direct cause-effect, problem-solution, or goal-method pairs
   - **Process sequences:** Sequential steps, temporal progressions, or logical flows
   - **Conceptual elaboration:** Detailed explanations, examples, or clarifications
   - **Hierarchical relationships:** Part-whole, general-specific, or category-instance

4. **Enhanced Discourse Pattern Detection:**
   - **Temporal sequence markers:** "first", "then", "next", "finally" → "follows" relationship
   - **Causal chain markers:** "because", "therefore", "so", "leads to" → "leads to" or "enables"
   - **Elaboration markers:** "specifically", "for example", "such as" → "elaborates on" (encourages APPEND/merge)
   - **Contrast markers:** "but", "however", "alternatively" → "contrasts with" (encourages branching)
   - **Implementation markers:** "To do this/The way to/How we" → "implements"
   - **Problem-solution markers:** "The issue is/To fix this/The solution" → "addresses"

5. **Relationship Selection:** Choose the most specific and semantically accurate relationship type.

6. **Connection Requirement:** Use `NO_RELEVANT_NODE` ONLY when the chunk introduces a completely new topic with no logical connection to existing content.

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY this JSON structure:
```json
{{
  "analyzed_chunks": [
    {{
      "name": "original chunk name",
      "text": "original chunk text",
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of connection choice",
      "relevant_node_name": "Node or chunk name" or "NO_RELEVANT_NODE",
      "relationship": "relationship type" or null
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Example:**

**Existing Nodes:** `[{{"name": "Project Setup", "summary": "Initial project configuration and requirements gathering"}}]`

**Sub-chunks:** `[{{"name": "Database Choice", "text": "We decided to use PostgreSQL for better performance with complex queries", "is_complete": true}}, {{"name": "API Framework", "text": "FastAPI will be our web framework due to its async capabilities", "is_complete": true}}]`

**Expected Output:**
```json
{{
  "analyzed_chunks": [
    {{
      "name": "Database Choice", 
      "text": "We decided to use PostgreSQL for better performance with complex queries",
      "reasoning": "This chunk describes a specific technical decision that implements the broader project setup process. It provides concrete implementation details for the database component, showing a strong semantic connection that could warrant merging with the setup discussion.",
      "relevant_node_name": "Project Setup",
      "relationship": "implements"
    }},
    {{
      "name": "API Framework",
      "text": "FastAPI will be our web framework due to its async capabilities", 
      "reasoning": "This chunk also describes a technical decision that implements the project setup. Like the database choice, it provides specific technology selection details with strong semantic connection to the setup process.",
      "relevant_node_name": "Project Setup",
      "relationship": "implements"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

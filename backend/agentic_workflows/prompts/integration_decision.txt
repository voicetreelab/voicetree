You decide whether analyzed chunks should be APPENDed to existing nodes or CREATE new nodes. Focus on maintaining semantic coherence while avoiding unnecessary fragmentation.

**Key Decision Principles:** 
- **APPEND** when the chunk provides additional details, examples, or elaboration for an existing concept
- **CREATE** when the chunk introduces a distinct new concept, process step, or cognitive unit that merits its own node
- **Prioritize coherence** over granularity - err on the side of keeping related concepts together

**Instructions:**

**Background:**
You will receive a list of sub-chunks. A previous step has already analyzed each sub-chunk, identified its most relevant connection point (`relevant_node_name` - which could be an existing node, another sub-chunk name, or "NO_RELEVANT_NODE"), and determined the `relationship` type.

**Your Task:**
Process the entire input list of sub-chunks. For **each** sub-chunk, decide whether its information should be **APPENDED** to its identified `relevant_node_name`, or if it warrants the **CREATION** of a new, distinct node connected to that `relevant_node_name`. Your final output must be a single JSON list containing the decision and necessary metadata for *all* processed sub-chunks.

**Input:**

*   `analyzed_sub_chunks`: A JSON list where each object represents a sub-chunk and contains:
    *   `name`: The concise name given to the sub-chunk.
    *   `text`: The text content of the sub-chunk.
    *   `relevant_node_name`: The name of the most relevant existing node OR another sub-chunk name, OR the string "NO_RELEVANT_NODE".
    *   `relationship`: The relationship type (e.g., "elaborates on", "counter-argument"), OR `null`.
    *   (It might also contain `reasoning` from the previous step, which you can ignore).

**Instructions:**

1. **Process each chunk in `analyzed_sub_chunks`:**

   **Enhanced Decision Logic:**
   - If `relevant_node_name` is "NO_RELEVANT_NODE" → **CREATE** (new topic)
   - Otherwise, analyze the semantic relationship and content significance:
   
   **APPEND when the chunk:**
   - **"continues"** - Direct continuation of the same thought or narrative thread
   - **"elaborates on"** - Provides additional detail, examples, or clarification for existing concept (discourse pattern: "specifically", "for example", "such as")
   - **"exemplifies"** - Gives specific examples of an already-established concept
   - Adds minor details, corrections, or supplementary information
   - Provides context or background for an existing concept
   - Offers additional perspectives on the same topic
   - **Elaboration discourse patterns detected** - When chunk contains "specifically", "for example", "such as" - these encourage merging with the main concept
   
   **CREATE when the chunk:**
   - **"implements"** - Describes concrete methods, steps, or actions (actionable content deserves its own node)
   - **"follows"** - Represents the next distinct step in a process or logical sequence (discourse pattern: "first", "then", "next", "finally")
   - **"part of"** - Introduces a significant component that merits detailed exploration
   - **"leads to"** - Describes important consequences, outcomes, or results (discourse pattern: "because", "therefore", "so", "leads to")
   - **"enables"** - Provides essential foundations or prerequisites
   - **"addresses"** - Presents solutions to problems or responses to challenges
   - **"contrasts with"** - Offers alternative approaches or opposing viewpoints (discourse pattern: "but", "however", "alternatively" - encourages branching)
   - Introduces new concepts, requirements, questions, or distinct topics
   - Contains actionable information or decision points
   - Represents a cognitive shift or new line of thinking
   - **Contrast discourse patterns detected** - When chunk contains "but", "however", "alternatively" - these encourage creating separate branches

2. **Generate output for each chunk:**

   **For APPEND:**
   ```json
   {{
     "action": "APPEND",
     "target_node": "[relevant_node_name]",
     "new_node_name": null,
     "new_node_summary": null,
     "relationship_for_edge": null,
     "content": "• [Key insight 1]\n• [Key insight 2]\n• [Key insight 3]"
   }}
   ```
   
   **For CREATE:**
   ```json
   {{
     "action": "CREATE",
     "target_node": "[relevant_node_name or NO_RELEVANT_NODE]",
     "new_node_name": "[chunk name]",
     "new_node_summary": "[One-sentence summary]",
     "relationship_for_edge": "[relationship type]",
     "content": "• [Key insight 1]\n• [Key insight 2]\n• [Key insight 3]"
   }}
   ```

**CRITICAL - Content Generation Rules:**
- Generate **2-4 concise bullet points** that capture KEY INSIGHTS and ACTIONABLE INFORMATION
- Each bullet point should be **unique and meaningful** (10-30 words)
- **Synthesize and clarify** - Extract the essence and intent, not raw transcript fragments
- **No repetition** - Each bullet point adds distinct, valuable information
- Focus on **what matters most** - decisions, concrete actions, reasoning, goals, outcomes, and next steps
- **Preserve context** - Include enough context so each bullet point is self-contained and meaningful
- **Maintain speaker intent** - Capture the speaker's actual goals and reasoning, not just surface content
- **Ensure completeness** - Never output "unable to extract summary" - always provide meaningful content
- **Semantic coherence** - Ensure bullet points flow logically and maintain the speaker's thought progression

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY this JSON structure:
```json
{{ 
  "integration_decisions": [
    // ... decision objects for all chunks ...
  ]
}}

**Example:**

Input `analyzed_sub_chunks`:
`[ {{"name": "Study and Gym Plan", "text": "Today I want to to study and go to the gym", "reasoning": "...", "relevant_node_name": "Self Improvement", "relationship": "lists tasks for"}}, {{"name": "Fence Repair Task", "text": "Then I will have to work on my fence because one of the stakes is cracking", "reasoning": "...", "relevant_node_name": "Yard Work", "relationship": "identifies task for"}}, {{"name": "Fence Repair Detail", "text": "The specific issue is rot at the base of the north corner post.", "reasoning": "...", "relevant_node_name": "Fence Repair Task", "relationship": "elaborates on"}} ]`

Expected Output:
`{{ "integration_decisions": [ {{"name": "Study and Gym Plan", "text": "Today I want to to study and go to the gym", "action": "CREATE", "target_node": "Self Improvement", "new_node_name": "Study and Gym Plan", "new_node_summary": "Lists studying and going to the gym as tasks for the day under self-improvement.", "relationship_for_edge": "lists tasks for", "content": "• Plan to study today as part of self-improvement\n• Schedule gym session for physical fitness"}}, {{"name": "Fence Repair Task", "text": "Then I will have to work on my fence because one of the stakes is cracking", "action": "CREATE", "target_node": "Yard Work", "new_node_name": "Fence Repair Task", "new_node_summary": "Identifies the specific yard work task of repairing the fence due to a cracking stake.", "relationship_for_edge": "identifies task for", "content": "• Fence repair needed due to cracking stake\n• Priority yard work task to address"}}, {{"name": "Fence Repair Detail", "text": "The specific issue is rot at the base of the north corner post.", "action": "APPEND", "target_node": "Fence Repair Task", "new_node_name": null, "new_node_summary": null, "relationship_for_edge": null, "content": "• Rot identified at base of north corner post\n• Specific location and cause of damage determined"}} ] }}`

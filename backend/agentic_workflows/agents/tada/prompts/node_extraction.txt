You are extracting new node names from integration decisions to create meaningful, well-structured knowledge graph nodes.

Given the integration decisions below, extract ONLY the names of nodes that should be created (action="CREATE").

Integration decisions:
```{extract}```

Existing nodes that should NOT be included:
```{nodes}```

Instructions:
1. Look for entries where "action": "CREATE"
2. Extract the "new_node_name" value from those entries
3. Ensure node names are meaningful and descriptive (3-8 words)
4. Return the node names as a JSON object with "new_nodes" array
5. Do NOT include nodes that already exist in the existing nodes list
6. Verify that each node name captures a complete concept or cognitive unit

**Example:**

**Integration decisions:**
```
[
  {{"name": "Meeting Setup", "action": "APPEND", "target_node": "Project Planning", "new_node_name": null}},
  {{"name": "Database Design", "action": "CREATE", "target_node": "Technical Architecture", "new_node_name": "Database Schema"}},
  {{"name": "User Authentication", "action": "CREATE", "target_node": "Security Requirements", "new_node_name": "Login System"}}
]
```

**Existing nodes:** `["Project Planning", "Technical Architecture", "Security Requirements"]`

**Expected output:** 
```json
{
  "new_nodes": ["Database Schema", "Login System"]
}
```

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format. Do not include any explanatory text.

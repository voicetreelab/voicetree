This section should not be treated as an isolated concept but rather as a summary that implicitly connects to the other discussed topics. The failure to establish connections, while creating 'Next Steps' as a new node, highlights a weakness in fully understanding the context and relationships between the meeting's agenda items.  The improved clarity would involve tying 'Next Steps' to the other items as a follow-up or overarching goal.  Additionally, the system could be improved by identifying and extracting relational information beyond topic identification; for example, assigning individuals responsible for tasks would significantly enrich the knowledge graph. The inconsistency between `analyzed_chunks` and `integration_decisions` also needs to be addressed. The system needs better integration between these sections to avoid confusion and inconsistency."

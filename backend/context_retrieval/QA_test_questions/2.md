Question 2

A macOS user wants to process their audio for a new dataset. They have downloaded the UVR5 client from the provided cloud disk link, but their audio has extremely heavy, "perverted" reverb. According to the recommended best practices and tool limitations described in the manual, what is their correct course of action?

    A) Use the built-in UVR5-WebUI and select the DeEcho-Aggressive model, as the client version has compatibility issues on macOS.

    B) In the UVR5 client, use the MDX23C model for vocal extraction, followed by the UVR-De-Echo-Dereverb model to handle the extreme reverb.

    C) Use the UVR5 client's recommended Bs-Roformer-Viperx-1297 model for vocal extraction, followed by the UVR-De-Echo-Dereverb model for the reverb.

    D) Pull the UVR5 beta version code from the repository and install it themselves, as this is the only way to access the best Bs-Roformer model on a Mac.

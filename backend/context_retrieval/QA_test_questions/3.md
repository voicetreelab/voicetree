Question 3

A user is performing TTS inference and finds the output speech is very repetitive, often repeating words or short phrases. Based on the troubleshooting advice and parameter explanations in the manual, which of the following adjustments is the most direct and recommended way to address this specific issue?

    A) Increase the top_p, top_k, and temperature values to their maximum to introduce more randomness and break the repetition cycle.

    B) Retrain the model from scratch, but this time ensure all tags in the dataset are 100% manually proofread, as this is the likely root cause of repetition.

    C) Decrease the repetition_penalty parameter to a value less than 1 to strongly discourage the model from repeating tokens.

    D) Switch to a GPT model from an earlier epoch (lower 'e' value) and shorten the length of the text being synthesized in each segment.

Scenario: A venture capitalist is evaluating VoiceTree. They are impressed by the technology but raise two critical concerns: 1) The significant challenge of selling a new, untested AI product directly to large enterprises due to a lack of trust (114), and 2) The unresolved enterprise policy barrier regarding public AI data training (53).
Based on a holistic analysis of the commercialization strategy, which of the following statements best explains how the proposed "Pay-on-Demand Monetization Model" (83) is strategically designed to mitigate both of these core VC concerns?
A) It prioritizes achieving a benchmark (110) which will prove the technology's value, attracting VCs who can then provide the resources and credibility needed to overcome enterprise sales hurdles.
B) It focuses on creating a consumer-facing website (100) to rapidly acquire a large user base (109), which directly demonstrates market validation and builds the trust required for enterprise sales, thereby bypassing the policy barriers.
C) It serves as a strategic first phase to build a user base and establish product value with individual consumers, creating a pathway to a more secure, trusted enterprise version (103) that can then properly address the policy barriers.
D) It provides immediate revenue and real-time user feedback (101) that can be used to fund the one-month development effort needed to create a shareable, browser-hosted version (74, 75), which is the main prerequisite for enterprise adoption.

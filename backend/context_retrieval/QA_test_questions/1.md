Question 1

A user is training a model on a powerful computer with a 24GB graphics card. They have a high-quality, 3-hour dataset and want the absolute best result, regardless of training time. Based on the documentation's guidelines and warnings, what is the most appropriate training strategy for them to adopt?

    A) Set the SoVITS model to train for several hundred rounds and enable DPO training, as high rounds are best for large datasets and powerful hardware.

    B) Keep the SoVITS and GPT model rounds low (e.g., around 10-20), enable DPO training, and first use Emotion2Vec to classify the dataset.

    C) Disable DPO training to maximize the batch size for faster training, and increase the SoVITS rounds significantly since the dataset is high quality.

    D) Enable DPO training and set the GPT model rounds to the maximum possible, but keep the SoVITS rounds at the default, as it's more prone to negative effects.

### The `load_dur.py` script's function for loading existing trees from markdown doesn't return any value, causing confusion.

I'm just seeing a problem right now with load existing tree from markdown. In load_dur.py, which is that it doesn't actually return anything. Um, so I'm a little bit confused. How it works.

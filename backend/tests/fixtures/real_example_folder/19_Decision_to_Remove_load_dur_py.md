title: Decision to Remove load_dur.py (19)
---
### Decision made against a centralized auto-load module, leading to the removal or refactoring of `load_dur.py`.

The decision is that we will not have a centralized auto-load module, which loads everything we need. Therefore, `load_dur.py` should be removed or refactored.

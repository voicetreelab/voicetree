title: Testing Difficulty of Decentralized Module Loading (35)
---
### Decentralized module loading makes testing slightly harder, but the exact degree of difficulty needs clarification.

One con to having it decentralized, which is it makes it a little bit harder to test. But it shouldn't be too hard. Um, and does the decentralized module loading, um, make it significantly harder, or it's actually not too bad?

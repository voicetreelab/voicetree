title: Implement History Manager for Transcripts (27)
---
### Proposes implementing a dedicated history manager for saving only processed transcript text, as an alternative to the current markdown vault method.

Ideally, the transcript history should be saved to a dedicated history manager, rather than directly to a markdown file in a vault folder. The history manager will save only processed text (completed text).

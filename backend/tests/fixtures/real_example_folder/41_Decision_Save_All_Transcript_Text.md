title: 'Decision: Save All Transcript Text? (41)'

### Should the history manager save all transcript text (even if not strictly needed), or only processed text?

Um, when maybe history should just save, um, all text. This is an alternative to saving only processed text, because it doesn't actually need it, but, um, is it the right thing to do?

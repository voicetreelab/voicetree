title: Observation on Workflow Overcomplication (26)
---
### Zoe's work is overcomplicated, with `chunk_processor.py`, `tree_action_decider_workflow.py`, and `history manager` potentially being unnecessary.

I'm just reviewing Zoe's work, and I think she's overcomplicated it because we don't need all these files to be changed. We don't need chunk processor.py and tree action decider workflow and history manager.

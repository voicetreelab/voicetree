title: Current Vector Loading Status (9)
---
### Uncertainty exists regarding the current implementation status of vector loading; it's not in `server.py` but potentially at the vector level.

I actually don't know the current state of the code regarding vector loading. It's not in `server.py`, but I think it still might be at the vector level:
backend/markdown_tree_manager/embeddings/chromadb_vector_store.py

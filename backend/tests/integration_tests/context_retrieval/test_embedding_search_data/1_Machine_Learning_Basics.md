### Introduction to machine learning concepts including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

### Key Concepts
- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning architectures
- **Classification**: Categorizing data into predefined classes
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values

### Exploring various neural network architectures including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.

Deep learning uses multi-layered neural networks to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. These architectures have revolutionized computer vision, natural language processing, and many other domains.

### Architecture Types
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Sequential data
- **Transformers**: Attention-based models
- **GANs**: Generative Adversarial Networks
- **Autoencoders**: Dimensionality reduction

### Techniques for processing and understanding human language using computational methods.

NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include chatbots, translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.

### Core Techniques
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words or subwords
- **Word Embeddings**: Vector representations of words
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying entities in text
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Grammatical analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining emotional tone

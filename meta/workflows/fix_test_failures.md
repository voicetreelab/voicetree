1. Out of the categories think hard, how could you best divide these into up to 7 different groupings to send to subagents?

2. Spawn the subagents in parallel. In the prompt to each subagent, warn them that you will end their session if you detect that they are reducing the quality of the tests in order to make them pass.

3. Update meta/reports/<report_from_task_1> that you created earlier, update it to contain the update status.

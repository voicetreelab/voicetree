Okay, we have our system green and working fairly well!!!

Lot's of little problems, and millions of things we could improve within the system, but we have to prioritise.

Possible tasks:

- summarize instead ~
- compress prompts  ~
- grade each agent component ~
- Punctuation buffer +

What do we actually want?

- our TADA system healthy, benchmark 3.5/5
    - Currently at 3/5, benchmarker says node fragmentation biggest problem
    - need to understand debug logs, but they are weird, are they reseeting after runs? "The voice is, uh," appears 7 times,
    - would also be nice to put debug logs in same output folder.

    So hypothisis for what would help:
     - Work Item based decomposition. Theory of Work Item.
     - punctuation buff could help, but our unfinished algo should cover for us...
- concise quality log ~

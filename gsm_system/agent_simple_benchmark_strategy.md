give the AGENT (claude) this prompt:

first,     get titles + summaries of nodes with python tool (get_voicetree_nodes.py)

While you need more context to answer question, and more unseen content exists in markdown folder:

    LLM chooses which ones it wants the full context of.
    


will then need to give it also input variables, such as 

- question
- markdown folder
- tool locations

that's it!

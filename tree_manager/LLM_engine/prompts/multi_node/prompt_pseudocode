First.

1. Concept extraction & labelling each part of the text with representative concept: Identify within the chunk all concepts at the granularity of a single thought.

?Req: more precise, rigogourus defintion & instructions for concept granularity.

 When doing this, consider the existing the nodes/concepts in the tree, and if text in the chunk is "essentially the same"
 label it with an existing the concept, instead of creating a duplicate synonymous concept.

 Req: quantitative measure to determine "essentially the same". Is there a tool I can give the LLM?

2. For each identified concept:

    a). concise summary of the parts of the chunk labelled with this concept.

    Choosing parent node & relationship to this concept:
    a) parent node: what node makes the most "sense" to have as the parent. Within the chunk or context is there a clear
    relationship with another concept? If so, use this. If not, set parent to the most related concept.
        - note "parent" node doesn't have to represent any parental or hierarchial relationship.

    b) relationship to parent:
        how can you best describe the relationship of the connection we are building between concept parent & concept child?

    Allowing for arbitrary chunk segmentations:
    c) finished thought... (First, if this concept was previously unfinished, determine whether it is complete with the
        new chunk, if so set it to complete, and you can consider in the summary the previously unfinished content. )

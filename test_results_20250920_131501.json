The context suggests work related to hook-based instruction injection, but I need specific direction.\n\nI'm ready to help! Since the source markdown file referenced doesn't exist, could you please tell me what specific task you'd like me to work on? I can see there's been recent work on:\n\n- Hook auto-tracking enhancements\n- Tree update logic\n- Animation fixes\n- UI improvements\n\nWhat would you like me to focus on?\n",

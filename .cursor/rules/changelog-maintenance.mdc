Whenever significant code changes have been made that affect the system's functionality, architecture, or user experience, you MUST update the CHANGELOG.md file.

## What constitutes a significant change:
- Bug fixes that resolve CI/CD failures or system crashes
- New features or architectural changes
- Testing philosophy or infrastructure changes
- API integrations or error handling improvements
- Performance optimizations or strategic simplifications
- Documentation or workflow improvements that affect developers

## Changelog Format:
- Use **[Current]** for the most recent unreleased work
- Include a descriptive title in bold
- Provide specific technical details about what was changed
- Mention file names and key technical concepts
- Keep entries concise but comprehensive
- Move **[Current]** to a commit hash when work is committed

## When to update:
- Immediately after completing a significant debugging session
- After implementing new features or architectural changes
- Before suggesting git commits (as part of git-commit rule)
- When major testing or CI/CD changes are made

## Process:
1. Read the current CHANGELOG.md
2. Update the **[Current]** entry with new work details
3. Ensure the technical details are accurate and specific
4. Maintain the existing format and style

Always ask yourself: "Would a developer need to know about this change to understand the system's evolution?" If yes, update the changelog.

In addition to [problem-solving-meta-strategy.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/problem-solving-meta-strategy.mdc) since this is a complex problem, and may require a complex solution. 

Be critical about whether it is truly the right thing to do. Are we solving the right problem? 

1. Explore alternative goals that would lead to a different problem to solve entirely.

2. Once you have selected the correct problem to solve. Explore different solutions to this problem, and think deeply about the tradeoffs (such as which one minimizes complexity, whilst maximising accuracy)

3. make a plan, for the optimal way to approach this solution before attacking it. Visit [if-over-read-bible.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/if-over-read-bible.mdc) (todo make seperate tech-debt guidelines) to make sure you are minimizing the tech-debt of your solution.

4. add a memory (markdown file with your knowledge) to /meta/memories if you have learnt anything very interesting about the codebase, a gotcha, or anything that you think almost every engineer working on the system should know. MEMORIES SHOULD ONLY BE SHORT FACTS, KEEP IT EXTREMELY CONCISE. EACH MEMORY MAX one paragraph.

5. perform a git commit only to the files you have changed for this task

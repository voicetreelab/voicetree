First make sure you understand the voicetree voice to graph system.

look in existing open /meta/current_tasks/current_tasks_index.txt to see if there any existing tasks that do something similar or potentially incompatible.
If not, create a new task md file here. Include your plan of how to solve this problem. Be critical of this plan. Make sure we are solving the right problem, and our solution will follow the rules of the bible [if-over-read-bible.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/if-over-read-bible.mdc) to not create tech debt. Be especially wary of adding unnecessary complexity.

then look at memory_index.txt to see if there any relevant memories/knowledge that would be useful to have in context

Task: Orchestrate the work for @$OBSIDIAN_SOURCE_NOTE
Managing your agents. First think very hard about the task, and the proposed implementation plan. 

Use @/Users/bobbobby/repos/VoiceTreePoc/CREATE_SUBAGENTS_COMMAND.md as a guide for creating the .sh files which will launch the subagents.

Then return to the user a list of the commands needed to execute to run each agent.

When creating additional files connected to @$OBSIDIAN_SUBTASK_SOURCE_NOTE extending the markdown tree, ensure the new files are connected by markdown links 
e.g. `[[$OBSIDIAN_SOURCE_NOTE]]`,
For each of these new files, ensure the yaml front matter has `color: <color>`. e.g. color could be blue, green, yellow, red for each agent.

# Markers for test categorization
markers =
    unit: Unit tests (isolated, fast)
    integration: Integration tests (may use external resources)
    api: Tests that make real API calls (expensive)
    slow: Tests that take > 5 seconds
    smoke: Quick smoke tests for development
    coverage: Coverage threshold tests (CI only)
    asyncio: Asyncio tests requiring event loop
    cloud_functions: Tests that use deployed cloud functions instead of local agents
